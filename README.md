# Freshmen-Airport-Pickup-GAS
## Produced by Rice Chinese Students and Scholars Association(RCSSA) IT Team

## About
Each year more than 200 Chinese students arrive at Houston to start their new journey at Rice University. To help them quickly adapt to the new environment 
and make new friends, the RCSSA IT team developed this platform to pick up these new students from the airport.

## Procedure
1. New students enter their arrival time and airports (IAH/HOU) through a Google form. (Only Accessible to google account registered under Rice University)
2. Volunteers can see all the students that are waiting to be picked up through another Google form. (Open to everyone)
3. Volunteers select the students they would like to pick up; RCSSA volunteers will inspect and verify volunteers' identities.
4. Volunteers and new students will both receive an email containing contact information from each other.

## Used Tech

### Goole App Script(GAS)
Google App Script allows us to interact with the google suite(form, sheet, doc, gmail, etc.) in real time. 

### Google Form
Google Form allows us to publish questionnaires and collect information from students and volunteers. And together with GAS, we can attach some callback functions to tiggers(openning, submitting forms) in Google form.

### Google Sheet
Google Sheet serves like our database in this program. All the information we collected is stored in Google Sheet.
